# Mix — project conventions

Purpose: a shared web app replacing KYTC's MixPack and AMAW workbooks, now known
as **DesignBook** and **PlantBook** respectively. A joint effort between KYTC and
contractors.

Collaborators: **Jacob** and **Andrew**, working from separate Claude accounts
against this shared repo. Neither can see the other's chats — this file is the
shared context. If you learn something durable about the project, add it here
rather than leaving it in a conversation.

## Ground rules for Claude Code

- Read this file and the existing code before proposing changes.
- Deliver full, runnable files. Do not hand back patch fragments or
  "add this near line 40" snippets.
- One concern per commit. Small commits, clear messages.
- Never commit secrets. API keys live in Netlify environment variables and are
  read server-side only. If a key is needed client-side, that is a design
  error — proxy it instead.
- Do not rewrite git history or force-push. Two people work here.
- If a change touches a file the other person is likely editing, say so in the
  commit message.

## Architecture conventions

- **Single-file HTML app.** One `.html` file: markup, CSS, and JS together. No
  build step, no bundler, no framework unless there is a specific reason.
- **DesignBook and PlantBook are two views of one app**, not two apps. One
  file, one deploy, shared CONFIG and styling. See "Working in one file" below.
- **CONFIG block at the top.** Every app opens with a single `CONFIG` object
  holding all tunable values — endpoints, thresholds, spec limits, plant lists,
  feature flags. No magic numbers buried in functions.
- **Netlify static hosting.** The `.html` file deploys as-is.
- **Netlify Functions as API-key proxies.** Any third-party API call goes
  through a function in `netlify/functions/`. The browser never sees a key.
- **Client-side JSON knowledge bases.** Reference data ships as a JSON file
  loaded at runtime, with BM25 retrieval when search is needed.
- **No localStorage in artifacts.** In-memory state only for anything that will
  run inside Claude. Standalone Netlify apps may use localStorage.

## Working in one file

Both collaborators edit the same `.html`. That is a merge-conflict machine
unless we are deliberate about it:

- **Own your view.** Each view's markup, CSS, and JS stays in one contiguous
  block, fenced by a banner comment. Stay out of the other view's block.

  ```html
  <!-- ===== DESIGNBOOK ===== -->
  ...
  <!-- ===== END DESIGNBOOK ===== -->
  ```

- **Shared ground gets its own commit.** CONFIG, utility functions, and global
  styles belong to both of us. Change them in a small, separate commit so the
  other person can pull past it cleanly.
- **Pull before you start. Push as soon as it works.** Long-running local edits
  are what become conflicts. Small and often beats big and clean.
- **Say what you reached into.** If a commit touches anything outside your own
  view, put that in the commit message.

## Python conventions

- `openpyxl` for Excel read/write.
- `pdfplumber` for PDF parsing.
- `reportlab` for PDF generation.
- Anchor spreadsheet reads on **labels, not fixed cell addresses**. Find the
  label cell, then offset. KYTC workbooks move between revisions.
- Scripts are standalone and runnable with explicit paths, no notebook-only
  code.

## Domain notes

<!-- FILL IN as the project develops. -->

### DesignBook
Formerly the **MixPack** workbook.

### PlantBook
Formerly the **AMAW** workbook.

### Specifications and tolerances
TBD — cite the governing spec section when encoding a limit in code.

### Gotchas found the hard way
- (Log real bugs here so the other person does not rediscover them.)
- Supabase's **anon/public key** is not a secret like a normal API key — it is
  meant to ship in client-side JS (Supabase's own docs do this). Access
  control comes from Row Level Security (RLS) policies on your tables, not
  from hiding this key. So it's fine to put it directly in a `CONFIG` block
  in a single-file app; it does NOT need a Netlify Function proxy. The
  **service_role key** is the real secret — that one must never leave a
  Netlify Function/env var, ever.

  **RLS must be enabled on every table before the anon key ships — no
  exceptions.** The anon key is only safe *because* RLS is on. With RLS off,
  that key hands anyone who views source full read/write access to the whole
  database. Enabling RLS with no policy denies everything by default, which
  is the safe starting point: turn it on first, then add policies.

- **An UPDATE (or DELETE) policy alone cannot "claim" a row for a user who
  doesn't own it yet — this silently updates 0 rows, always, and looks like
  it's just not working.** Postgres requires a row to pass the table's
  SELECT policy before an UPDATE can even see it to modify it. If your SELECT
  policy is `user_id = auth.uid()`, an unclaimed row (`user_id is null`) can
  never pass that check — `null = auth.uid()` is never true — so a
  first-claim-wins UPDATE policy like `using (user_id is null) with check
  (user_id = auth.uid())` never actually fires. No error, no exception, just
  an update that silently touches 0 rows every single time. Found this by
  testing the claim flow with a rolled-back transaction against the real
  schema before ever pointing a real user at it — the fix is a
  `SECURITY DEFINER` function (bypasses RLS internally, so it can see and
  update the unclaimed row) instead of loosening the SELECT policy (which
  would expose the whole unclaimed roster to any authenticated user). See
  `claim_technician()` in `supabase/schema.sql` for the working pattern —
  and note it still needs `revoke execute ... from anon` explicitly, since a
  newly created function is otherwise callable by `anon` too (Supabase's
  database linter / `get_advisors` catches this — run it after any DDL
  change, not just once).

### Technician login & plant access

Login identity and plant-access scoping are two different keys, bridged by
one column:

- **The roster has no email addresses at all** — technicians are identified
  purely by SM ID (e.g. `jcavanah`). Supabase Auth's password provider still
  needs *some* email internally, so accounts get a fabricated one
  (`${sm_id}@technicians.mix.local`) the technician never sees until they
  onboard.
- **Accounts are bulk-provisioned, not self-signed-up.** All 376 technician
  auth accounts were created directly (an admin action against the
  database, done once — see `technicians.user_id` being set at the same
  time as the `auth.users` row, no separate claim step for this
  population) with the fabricated email and a **shared temporary
  password**. `claim_technician(sm_id)` still exists for onboarding anyone
  added to the roster *after* this initial rollout, but isn't part of the
  normal flow anymore.
- **Onboarding, forced on first real sign-in.** A technician's first
  sign-in uses SM ID + the temp password. `login.html` checks
  `technicians.onboarded`: if false, it walks them through setting a real
  email (confirmed via a real link Supabase sends — requires "Secure email
  change" turned OFF in Supabase Auth, since the old/fake address can never
  confirm anything) and then a real password, calling
  `mark_technician_onboarded()` (same SECURITY DEFINER pattern as
  `claim_technician()`) once both are done. Which of the two onboarding
  steps to resume into is decided by whether the account's current email is
  still the fake one, not by a step counter — so abandoning onboarding
  partway and coming back later resumes correctly. After onboarding, sign-in
  uses their real email + their own password, and Supabase's normal
  "forgot password" flow works since there's now a real address on file.
- **Known, accepted tradeoff during rollout**: every account starts with
  the *same* temp password, and that password is now written down in this
  file and in chat history. Until a technician onboards, anyone who knows
  or guesses their SM ID can sign in as them. Get people onboarded quickly,
  and don't publish this repo (or this chat) somewhere the temp password
  becomes public knowledge beyond your own team.
- Supabase's free-tier email sending is rate-limited to a handful of
  emails/hour — nowhere near enough to onboard 376 people in a reasonable
  window. A custom SMTP provider (Resend, SendGrid, etc.) needs to be wired
  into Supabase Auth settings before rolling this out broadly, or
  onboarding will stall on rate-limit errors partway through.
- Which plants (AMP numbers) a technician can see comes from
  `technician_plant_access`, a normalized (sm_id, amp_number) table — not
  the horizontal `AMP 1..AMP N` columns the roster spreadsheet uses for
  human readability.
- **Certifications gate which book(s) a technician can use, not just which
  plants.** Two cert types: `plant_tech` (everyone has this — it's earned
  first) and `mix_design_tech` (earned later, implies plant_tech-level
  competency). Plant Tech alone -> PlantBook only. Both certs -> PlantBook
  *and* DesignBook. This lives in `technician_certifications`
  (sm_id, cert_type, expires_on) plus a `technician_capabilities` view that
  computes `can_access_plantbook` / `can_access_designbook` gated on the
  cert being **currently unexpired** — a lapsed cert loses that access
  until the roster is updated and re-seeded, it doesn't stay granted
  forever just because the row exists. `login.html` already queries this
  view and shows the two badges post-login as a preview of what the
  real app will gate.
- Any future table holding real DesignBook/PlantBook data should scope its
  RLS off `technician_capabilities` (the plantbook/designbook yes-or-no
  gate) and `technician_plant_access` (which AMP numbers) — both already
  resolve from `auth.uid()` the same way, so join or reuse rather than
  re-deriving the logic a third time.
- The roster spreadsheets are the source of truth, not the database. When
  either changes, regenerate with `scripts/build_technician_seed.py`
  (it now takes *both* the Technician Plant Access file and the original
  per-cert roster file — see its docstring) and re-import via Supabase's
  Table Editor or SQL Editor. The generated CSVs/SQL contain real names —
  they are gitignored, never commit them.

## Conventions for changing this file

Both collaborators edit `CLAUDE.md`. To avoid merge conflicts, append to the
end of a section rather than restructuring, and keep edits to one section per
commit where possible.
